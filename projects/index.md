## Hacker School

I was in the Winter 2014 batch of [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com).
I did a number of projects, including front-end Javascript + HTML + CSS,
back-end Javascript in Node.js, and functional programming in Scala and Clojure.

### Game of Life in many Javascript frameworks

I implemented the Game of Life in several different Javascript frameworks.
I wrote a post about it [here](/2014/05/17/gol-react.html).
