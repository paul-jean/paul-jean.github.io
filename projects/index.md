### Teaching experimental computation at the Wolfram Science Summer School

The Wolfram Science Summer School was always my favorite time of year. I wrote
a [blog post](http://blog.wolfram.com/2012/12/20/hunting-for-turing-machines-at-the-wolfram-science-summer-school/)
about the kind of science project we did there.
