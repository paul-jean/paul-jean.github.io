At the beginning of my Hacker School batch I paired with [Jake](https://twitter.com/\_JacobJacob) on a
Javascript implementation of
Conway's Game of Life, as a way to learn Javascript and HTML5 canvas:

{% include figure.html url="../../../images/gol-js-canvas.gif" description="Game of Life with JS using HTML5 canvas" width="100%" %}

But our code felt a bit hacky, using global state all over the place. For example, the `draw`
function here calls `exports.game.update()`, which relies entirely on side effects to update the game state:

``` javascript
var draw = function() {
  var update = function(){
    exports.game.update();
    renderGrid(exports.context, exports.game.grid, exports.WIDTH, exports.HEIGHT);
  };
  exports.intervalId = setInterval(update, 100);
};
```

So after doing a code review with [Mary](http://www.twitter.com/maryrosecook) I
[refactored](https://github.com/paul-jean/life/commit/704b10c8618359cc29a6d6a4d4782cef590e3c09)
it into a more functional style to
eliminate as much global state as I could. Instead of `exports.game.update()`, I created a `stepGame`
function that takes the current game state and returns a new one:

``` javascript
var startAnimate = function() {
  var update = function(){
    gameState = stepGame(gameState);
    renderGrid(ctx, gameState, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  };
  intervalId = setInterval(update, 100);
};
```

Then I wondered how you'd implement the same
interface using [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), so [Damian](https://twitter.com/damiankao) and I
[refactored it again](https://github.com/paul-jean/life/commit/1da8eace529bbbd326850ec40a4823cd7a4370d8)
using SVG graphics managed by D3:

{% include figure.html url="../../../images/gol-d3.gif" description="Game of Life with D3.js" width="100%" %}

With D3 you treat the
DOM kind of like a database, selecting groups of SVG elements and transformations on
them:

``` javascript
base.render = function() {
  _svg
    .selectAll('g')
    .selectAll('rect')
    .attr('fill', function(d,i) {
        if (d[2]) return 'black';
        else return 'white';
        })
  return base;
}
```

Around that time I heard about Facebook's [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/) framework,
and [Thomas](https://twitter.com/thomasABoyt), a Hacker School
alum who knew React, happened to be visiting that week. So I paired with him and
refactored the code
[yet again](https://github.com/paul-jean/life/blob/5ac1698942a782a26a77d9b7556bf894fe0ee25b/life.js)
to use React for managing the SVG elements:

{% include figure.html url="../../../images/gol-react.gif" description="GOL in React.js (using SVG elements)"  width="100%" %}

Now the GOL grid was a React component (a `Board`),
containing individual `Cell` components. Each step the board is created entirely anew with fresh
cells whose color is determined by the state of the `Board` component:

``` javascript
var Board = React.createClass({
  ...
  render: function() {
    var a = [];
    for (var row=0; row<50; row++) {
      for (var col=0; col<50; col++) {
        a.push(<Cell
               dim='10' col={col} row={row}
               key={row + ',' + col}
               fill={this.state[[row, col]].val === 1 ? 'black': 'white'}
               handleCellClicked={this.handleCellClicked}
               />);
      }
    }
    return (
      <div>
        <input id="startButton" type="button" value="start" onClick={this.handleStart}/>
        <input id="stopButton" type="button" value="stop" onClick={this.handleStop}/>
        <svg>
          {a}
        </svg>
      </div>
    )
  },
  ...
});
```

Every time the `Board` component's `render` method is called, React sends the returned elements to
the _virtual DOM_ it maintains internally. The vDOM is inspected for the actual differences that
warrant DOM mutations between invocations of `getNextAnimationFrame`, using an optimized algorithm
for diffing the vDOM tree.

I was really curious to see the performance difference between a naive Javascript
implementation and the React implementation. So I wrote a Chrome browser extension that highlights
DOM elements being dynamically changed on any web page:

{% include figure.html url="../../../images/dom-viz-test.gif" description="DOM viz Chrome extension highlighting DOM elements being mutated"  width="100%" %}

For an apples-to-apples comparison of pure Javascript and React, I re-implemented the pure Javascript version again, this time
using divs for each cell on the grid. The `updateGrid` function now adds a fresh div of the appropriate color for all the cells
on the grid:

```javascript
var updateGrid = function(gameState) {
  newGrid();
  var row, col, cellId, rowColDiv;
  for (row = 0; row < gameState.dim; row ++) {
    for (col = 0; col < gameState.dim; col ++) {
      cellId = "r" + row + "c" + col;
      rowColDiv = document.getElementById(cellId);
      if (gameState.grid[row][col].val === 1) {
        rowColDiv.style.backgroundColor = "black";
      } else if (gameState.grid[row][col].val === 0) {
        rowColDiv.style.backgroundColor = "white";
      }
    }
  }
};
```

... where the `newGrid` function wipes the old grid and re-adds fresh divs each time:

```javascript
var newGrid = function() {
  var row, col, rowDiv;
  gameGrid = document.getElementById("grid");
  // remove existing rows
  if (document.getElementById("r" + 0)) {
    for (row = 0; row < gridSize; row ++) {
      rowDiv = document.getElementById("r" + row);
      gameGrid.removeChild(rowDiv);
    }
  }
  ...
  gameGrid.style.width = divSize * gridSize;
  // add 50 child divs for each row, with row ids 0-49
  for (row = 0; row < gridSize; row ++) {
    rowDiv = document.createElement('div');
    ...
      rowDiv.appendChild(rowColDiv);
    }
    gameGrid.appendChild(rowDiv);
  }
};
```

Then I did conceptually the same implementation in React, only I'm adding fresh `Cell` components to the vDOM
each game step, where the `Cell` component is really just a wrapper around a div (as before it was just a
wrapper around an svg `rect`):

```javascript
  var Cell = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
      var dim = this.props.dim;
      var col = this.props.col;
      var row = this.props.row;
      var leftAlignQ = col === 0 ? true : false;
      var style = {
        width: 10,
        height: 10,
        backgroundColor: this.props.color,
        border: "solid gray 1px",
        "float": "left",
        clear: leftAlignQ ? "both" : "none"
      };
      return (
        <div width = {dim} height = {dim} style = {style} >
        </div>
      );
    }
  });
```

At each step, the `Board` component is created anew with a fresh set of `Cell` components:

```javascript
  var Board = React.createClass({
    startAnimate: function() {
      var update = function(){
        this.setState(stepGame(this.state));
      }.bind(this);
      intervalId = setInterval(update, 100);
    },

    stopAnimate: function() {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
    },

    getInitialState: function () {
      return {grid: randomGameGrid(gridSize)};
    },
    render: function() {
      var a = [];
      for (var row=0; row<50; row++) {
        for (var col=0; col<50; col++) {
          a.push(<Cell
                 dim = '10' col = {col} row = {row}
                 color = {this.state.grid[row][col].val === 1 ? "black" : "white"}
                 />);
        }
      }
      return (
        <div>
          <input id="startButton" type="button" value="start" onClick={this.startAnimate}/>
          <input id="stopButton" type="button" value="stop" onClick={this.stopAnimate}/>
          <div width= {divSize * gridSize}>
            {a}
          </div>
        </div>
      )
    }
  });
```

Since I'm creating a new div for each cell on each time step in the pure Javascript version,
the DOM mutation visualizer highlights every cell on every step:

{% include figure.html url="../../../images/gol-js-div-dom-viz.gif" description="Pure Javascript GOL where each cell is a div" width="100%" %}

But in the React version, only the `Cell` components whose data actually change from step to step
are updated in the DOM:

{% include figure.html url="../../../images/gol-react-div-dom-viz.gif" description="React.js GOL where each cell is a React `Cell` component containing a div" width="100%" %}

This is an apples-to-apples comparison between Javascript and React, because I'm re-creating
a fresh set of cells at each game step in both cases. In the pure JS version, I'm
dumping a whole new set of divs into the DOM on each step. In the React version, I'm dumping
a whole new set of React components in the vDOM on each step.

I remember [Brian]() explaining this idea to me, that with React you just dump all new components
into the vDOM on every step, and let React take care of figuring out what needs to change in
the DOM. That was when I felt like I was starting to get the point of React, and why
it's powerful. I hope this little Game of Life demo makes that idea clear for others as well.
