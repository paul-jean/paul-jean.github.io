            <h3> Playing with scoping in JS [2014.02.19] </h3>
            <p>
                Did this <a href="https://gist.github.com/paul-jean/9097826">gist</a> with <a href="https://github.com/jskelcy">Jake</a>,
                who is introducing me to JS. We were trying to figure out how "this" works in JS objects. I wondered 
                if you do <br><br>

                var f = function() {var x = 10}; <br><br>

                ... whether "x" here implies "this.x" inside f. But it turns out x is referring to the 
                <em>global</em> namespace. You have to use "this" explicitly, i.e. <br><br>

                var f = function() {var this.x = 10};<br>
                var y = new f(); <br><br>

                ... in order to bind x to f's namespace.

            <h3> Advice from Mel Chua on Outing [2014.02.17] </h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Am I a local or global learner? 
                        i.e. Do I need to see the whole project scope before getting too deep into details?
                        Or do I like to start by working through the language specification?
                        I'm definitely a <em>global</em> learner 
                        (in physics I wanted to know <em>why</em> I was learning quantum mechanics) </li>
                    <li> Since I'm global, maybe tackle the web requests in the front/middle layers via the FB API, 
                        since that's where most of the logic is. </li>
                    <li> What language? Maybe Javascript since I want to learn it and it will help me with the front end too. 
                        (My suggestion; Mel doesn't get along with JS) </li>
                </ul>

            <h3> "Outing" web app: crowd-source your plans [2014.02.17] </h3>
            <p>
                An app that takes the pain out of making plans with friends. Create an "outing" and invite friends into it.
                Your friends can vote on things to do and places to go. The app uses the votes to create an itinerary everyone can see.
            </p>
            <p>
                Features:
                <ul>
                    <li> Connect with friends on FB, Foursquare, Google+, etc. </li>
                    <li> Give it a title, e.g. "Drinks tonight!", "Broadway show?", "Weekend in Miami" </li>
                    <li> Send out an open invite or choose friends to notify </li>
                    <li> Joiners can vote on things to do and places to go </li>
                    <li> The app creates an itinerary based on everone's votes </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Challenges:
                <ul>
                    <li> Can Outing decide what order to do things in? e.g. optimal path is the traveling salesman problem.
                        Hard in general but not bad if N < 10 or so. </li>
                    <li> Can Outing suggest things to do next? e.g. Just finished dinner at 7:30, suggest seeing "Her" at nearby theatre starting at 8. </li>
                </ul>
