            <h3 id="outing"> "Outing" web app: crowd-source your plans </h3>
            <p>
                An app that takes the pain out of making plans with friends. Create an "outing" and invite friends into it.
                Your friends can vote on things to do and places to go. The app uses the votes to create an itinerary everyone can see.
            </p>
            <p>
                Features:
                <ul>
                    <li> Connect with friends on FB, Foursquare, Google+, etc. </li>
                    <li> Give it a title, e.g. "Drinks tonight!", "Broadway show?", "Weekend in Miami" </li>
                    <li> Send out an open invite or choose friends to notify </li>
                    <li> Joiners can vote on things to do and places to go </li>
                    <li> The app creates an itinerary based on everone's votes </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Challenges:
                <ul>
                    <li> Can Outing decide what order to do things in? e.g. optimal path is the traveling salesman problem.
                        Hard in general but not bad if N < 10 or so. </li>
                    <li> Can Outing suggest things to do next? e.g. Just finished dinner at 7:30, suggest seeing "Her" at nearby theatre starting at 8. </li>
                </ul>
