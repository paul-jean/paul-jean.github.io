### MapReduce in Mathematica (2013)

I gave a talk at the Commercial Users of Functional Programming conference in 2013.
In part 1 I describe Mathematica's functional language, and in part 2 I describe
how to write algorithms in the MapReduce paradigm using Mathematica.
The video taken of this talk is available from the
[CUFP site](http://cufp.org/2013/Paul_Jean_Letourneau__Wolfram__Programming_Map_Reduce_in_Mathematica.html).
