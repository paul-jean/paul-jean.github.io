## About me

I'm an artist turned actor turned physicist turned data hacker turned web developer.

After getting a masters in computational physics, I hacked on genomes and a lot
of other data at Wolfram.
I then started translating my data mining and visualization experience into
open-source web technology at Recurse Center. I'm currently working as a web
developer in NYC.

One day, all of my past selves will unite to form [Voltron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZv5Z2Iz_s).

On this site you can check out my work on [data](data/), [front end web](frontend/),
[back end web](backend/), [blogging](writing/) I've done, and [talks](talks/) I've given,
and [science](science/) I work on.
