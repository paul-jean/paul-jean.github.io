## about me

Hi I'm Paul-Jean. Thanks for visiting!

I'm an artist turned actor turned physicist turned data hacker turned web developer.

After getting a masters in [computational physics](science/), I hacked on
[genomes](data/wolfram-alpha-genomics.html) and a lot of [other data](data/) at Wolfram.
I then started translating my data mining and visualization experience into
open-source web technology at [Recurse Center](talks/). I'm currently working as a web
developer in NYC.

One day, all of my past selves will unite to form [Voltron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZv5Z2Iz_s).

On this site you can check out my work on [data](data/), [front end web](frontend/),
[back end web](backend/), [blogging](writing/) I've done, [talks](talks/) I've given,
and [science](science/) I work on.

I am [@rule146](https://twitter.com/rule146) on Twitter and
[paul-jean](https://github.com/paul-jean) on GitHub.
