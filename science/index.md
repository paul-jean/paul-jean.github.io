### Class 3 cellular automata

I have done some computer experiments on a particular class 3 cellular automaton
rule known as rule 146. I blog about it on [rule146.com](http://www.rule146.com/).
I wrote a [Wordpress client](https://github.com/paul-jean/blog-this)
in the Wolfram language to post my notebooks directly to the blog. I described
the XML-RPC encoding process in a [blog post](http://www.rule146.com/category/mathematica/blogging/).
