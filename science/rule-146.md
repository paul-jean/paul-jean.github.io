## what is rule 146??

Rule 146 is an elementary class 3 cellular automaton rule. I think it's interesting
because its behavior seems largely random:

... but it may also be programmable via particle structures hidden in the evolution:

{% include figure.html url="../images/rule146-single-particle.png" description="Single particle propagating in rule 146." width="300px" %}

If rule 146 turns out to be generally programmable (i.e. if it could
[emulate a universal Turing machine](http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/)),
that would provide some evidence that class 3 (random-looking)
systems are generally programmable.
