## what is rule 146??

Rule 146 is an [elementary class 3 cellular automaton rule](http://wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-231).
I think rule 146 is interesting because although its behavior seems largely random:

... it may also be programmable via particle structures hidden in the evolution
(highlighted here in red):

If rule 146 turns out to be generally programmable (i.e. if it could
[emulate a universal Turing machine](http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/)),
that would provide some (circumstantial) evidence that class 3 (random-looking)
systems are generally programmable. See
[here](http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-715)
for more on why this is actually kind of a deep problem.
